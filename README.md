An automation testing project for a basic e-commerce web application using Java, Selenium WebDriver, and JUnit.

The test suite covers key user flows including registration, product selection, cart management, and order placement. Designed using the Page Object Model (POM) architecture for scalable and maintainable test code.

Test results are generated using Extent Reports and configured through XML. Includes validations, assertions, and element locators for UI testing.

Goal: Build a robust automation framework for web testing with industry-standard tools and practices.
